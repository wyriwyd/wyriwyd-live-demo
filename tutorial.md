Here be dragons!

*Dragon-name* is a package that helps you discover your dragon name. This may be very important in the future.
The basic usage is to take a single argument (your name).

```bash
dragon-name bob
```

```output
Your dragon name is: Erenkyl
```

Don't worry, not everyone has the same dragon name.

```bash
dragon-name bill
```

```output
Your dragon name is: Khoth
```

But if you don't like your dragon name, you can get a cryptographic variation with the "-b" option.

```bash
dragon-name -b bob
```

```output
Your dragon name is: Lyknere
```

Good luck in your dragon-related future!
